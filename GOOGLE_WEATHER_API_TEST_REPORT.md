# Google Weather API Test Report

## Summary

We have successfully verified that the Google Weather API key is working correctly and integrated the real API into the Super Sky App. The previous implementation was reporting a 404 error because it was using an incorrect request format.

## Testing Process

1. **Initial Testing**: We created a test script to make a direct request to the Google Weather API using the provided API key. The initial tests failed with a 404 error.

2. **Request Format Investigation**: We discovered that the API endpoint was correct, but the request format was wrong. The original implementation was using a POST request with a request body, but the API expects a GET request with query parameters.

3. **Curl Testing**: We created a test script using the exact curl command format from the documentation:
   ```
   curl -X GET "https://weather.googleapis.com/v1/forecast/hours:lookup?key=YOUR_API_KEY&location.latitude=37.4220&location.longitude=-122.0841&hours=25&pageSize=3"
   ```
   This test was successful, confirming that the API key is valid and the API is available.

4. **Implementation Update**: We updated the `fetchGoogleWeatherForecast` function in the `weather.js` file to use the correct request format:
   - Changed from POST to GET request
   - Used the exact URL format that worked with curl
   - Removed the request body and put all parameters in the URL query string

5. **Transformer Functions**: We updated the transformer functions to handle both the mock data format and the real API response format:
   - Updated `transformGoogleWeatherHourly` to handle the different field names and data structures
   - Updated `createGoogleWeatherCurrent` to extract current weather data from the API response
   - Added unit conversion for temperature (Celsius to Fahrenheit) and wind speed (km/h to mph)

6. **Integration Testing**: We tested the updated implementation with both the direct API endpoint and the triple-check endpoint, confirming that the Google Weather API is now working correctly and returning real data.

## Key Findings

1. **API Endpoint**: The Google Weather API endpoint `https://weather.googleapis.com/v1/forecast/hours:lookup` is valid and accessible.

2. **API Key**: The provided API key `AIzaSyD15QYUz9DPvooY80RV_ZvgG4VteWKWjtQ` is valid and has the necessary permissions to access the API.

3. **Request Format**: The API requires a specific request format:
   - HTTP Method: GET
   - Parameters: Must be in the URL query string, not in the request body
   - Parameter Names: Must use dot notation for nested parameters (e.g., `location.latitude` instead of just `latitude`)

4. **Response Format**: The API returns a JSON response with a different structure than the mock data:
   - Weather conditions are in a `weatherCondition` object with `type` and `description` fields
   - Temperature is in a `temperature` object with `unit` and `degrees` fields
   - Wind data is in a `wind` object with nested `direction` and `speed` objects
   - Precipitation data is in a `precipitation` object with nested `probability`, `qpf`, and `snowQpf` objects

## Implementation Changes

1. **Request Format**: Updated the `fetchGoogleWeatherForecast` function to use the correct request format:
   ```javascript
   const fullUrl = `${url}?key=${apiKey}&location.latitude=${latitude}&location.longitude=${longitude}&hours=24&pageSize=24`;
   
   const response = await axios({
     method: 'get',
     url: fullUrl,
     headers: {
       'Accept': 'application/json'
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Data Transformation**: Updated the transformer functions to handle both mock and real API data formats:
   - Added field mapping for different field names
   - Added unit conversion for temperature and wind speed
   - Added fallbacks for missing fields

3. **Error Handling**: Fixed an error in the route handler that was causing the API to return mock data even when the real API request was successful.

## Conclusion

The Google Weather API is now working correctly in the Super Sky App. The application is successfully retrieving real weather data from all four sources (AzureMaps, OpenMeteo, Foreca, and GoogleWeather) and displaying it in the comparison view.

The issue was not with the API key or the API endpoint, but with the request format. By updating the implementation to use the correct request format, we were able to successfully integrate the Google Weather API into the application.
