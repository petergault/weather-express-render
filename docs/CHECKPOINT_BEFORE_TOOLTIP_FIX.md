# Checkpoint: Super Sky App Before Tooltip Fix

## Current State Summary

The Super Sky app is currently in a stable state with the precipitation visualization feature working correctly. The app displays hourly precipitation forecasts from multiple weather services (Azure AccuWeather, Open Meteo, and Foreca) in a grid format. The precipitation data is visualized using color-coded bars that represent different precipitation intensities, with proper styling for continuous precipitation periods and special indicators for thunderstorms.

The app has recently undergone significant improvements to fix issues with the precipitation visualization, including proper rendering of precipitation bars, correct CSS layout, and improved border radius styling for continuous precipitation periods. These fixes have resulted in a reliable and visually appealing precipitation visualization.

However, there is still an issue with the tooltips showing HTML tags instead of rendering them properly when hovering over precipitation bars. This issue needs to be fixed while ensuring that the current precipitation visualization functionality remains intact.

## Key Modified Files for Precipitation Visualization

The following files have been modified to fix the precipitation visualization:

1. **HourlyComparisonGrid.jsx**
   - Refactored precipitation bar rendering logic
   - Implemented proper handling of precipitation data with null checks
   - Fixed border radius logic for continuous precipitation periods
   - Enhanced tooltip content generation with more detailed information
   - Improved accessibility with proper ARIA labels

2. **precipitationVisualizer.js**
   - Implemented functions to generate color-coded visualizations based on precipitation amounts
   - Created tooltip content generation with detailed precipitation information
   - Added unit conversion to ensure consistent visualization regardless of source unit (mm or inches)
   - Implemented border radius calculations for continuous precipitation periods

3. **CSS Files**
   - **hourly-grid.css**: Fixed the CSS for the precipitation row to ensure proper display
   - **precipitation-bar-chart.css**: Improved the segmented bar container styles for consistent display
   - **tooltip.css**: Added styles for tooltip display (though the HTML rendering issue remains)

## What's Working Correctly

1. **Precipitation Bars**
   - Color-coded visualization based on precipitation intensity (drizzle, light rain, moderate rain, heavy rain)
   - Proper segmentation with each hour represented as a separate DOM element
   - Correct border radius styling for continuous precipitation periods (rounded corners at the beginning and end)
   - Special styling for thunderstorms with yellow borders
   - Proper handling of different units (mm and inches) with consistent visualization

2. **Colors**
   - Appropriate color scheme for different precipitation intensities:
     - Drizzle (0.1-0.2mm): Very pale green
     - Light Rain (0.3-2mm): Light blue
     - Moderate Rain (2-5mm): Medium blue
     - Heavy Rain (>5mm): Purple
   - Proper handling of no precipitation (transparent background)
   - Special styling for thunderstorms

3. **Layout**
   - Proper grid layout with each weather service in its own row
   - Correct alignment and sizing of precipitation bars
   - Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
   - Proper service indicators for each weather source

## What Still Needs to Be Fixed

**Tooltip HTML Rendering Issue**
- Currently, tooltips are showing raw HTML tags instead of rendering them properly when hovering over precipitation bars
- This is because the HourlyComparisonGrid.jsx component is using the native HTML title attribute for tooltips (line 564), which doesn't support HTML rendering
- The precipitationVisualizer.js generates HTML content for tooltips (lines 168-186), but this HTML is not being properly rendered
- The Tooltip.jsx component has proper HTML rendering using dangerouslySetInnerHTML (line 154), but it's not being used for the precipitation bar tooltips in the current implementation

The fix will involve replacing the native title attribute with the custom Tooltip component that properly renders HTML content, while ensuring that all the current precipitation visualization functionality remains intact.

## Next Steps

The next task will be to fix the tooltip issue by:
1. Modifying HourlyComparisonGrid.jsx to use the custom Tooltip component instead of the native title attribute
2. Ensuring that the tooltip positioning works correctly with the precipitation bar layout
3. Testing the fix to ensure that tooltips render HTML properly without affecting the current precipitation visualization

This checkpoint serves as a safety net in case we need to revert changes if the tooltip fix causes any issues with the precipitation visualization.
