TEST 3: SERVER LOGS ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------
Based on server logs:
1. Initial request to Google Weather API is successful
2. Attempts to follow pagination tokens result in 400 errors
3. No fallback mechanism is successfully retrieving additional hours

FINAL VERDICT
--------------------------------------------------
âœ— Google Weather API integration has issues:
- Only returning 24 hours instead of the expected 240 hours
- Pagination is failing with 400 errors
- Other weather sources are returning more data

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Review the pagination implementation in fetchGoogleWeatherForecast
2. Implement more robust fallback mechanisms when pagination fails
3. Consider using multiple sequential requests with different time ranges
4. Verify API key permissions and rate limits
5. Check for any recent changes in the Google Weather API
